# Title

Data sharing as a new component of addressing and preparing for disease outbreaks

# Abstract

Public health emergencies require profound and swift action at scale with limited resources, often on the basis of incomplete information and frequently under rapidly evolving circumstances. While emergency-triggered sharing goes back millennia, data sharing is a relatively new flavour under this broader theme, but one that has been receiving attention over the last few years, especially in the context of public health emergencies like the Ebola or Zika outbreaks.

In response, researchers, research institutions, journals, funders and others have taken steps towards increasing the sharing of data around ongoing public health emergencies and in preparation for future ones. These measures range from the adoption of open lab notebooks to modifications of policies and funding lines, and they include conversations around infrastructure and cultural change.

In this contribution, I will provide an overview of different ways in which the sharing of data has played a role in public health emergencies, highlighting steps that have already been taken over the last decade as well as challenges still lying ahead.

While focusing on disease outbreaks, I will draw on examples from other public health emergencies as well (e.g. earthquakes or tropical storms) and discuss their applicability in the context of infections. The examples will span the entire data life cycle of public health emergencies, from preventive measures and routine public health surveillance data to the tracking of pathogens, investigating pathogen transmission and other host-pathogen interactions, as well as diagnostics, vaccination, epidemiological modelling, data ethics and other related topics, concluding with considerations around he potential impact of preserving and sharing data, or failing at that.


# About

This file hosts a contribution to [SciDataCon 2018](https://www.scidatacon.org/IDW2018/). Originally submitted as a separate session "Data sharing in public health emergencies", it was then merged into a related session [Open Data from Cell Biology of Infectious Pathogens, how far are we? ](https://www.scidatacon.org/IDW2018/sessions/262/), which was then merged further into the session [Health Databases across the African Continent: What do we have and what do we need for Sustainable Development?](https://www.scidatacon.org/IDW2018/sessions/222/) taking place on 6 November at 14:00â€“15:30 in rooms Serondela 1 and 2, where this contribution will be one of four oral presentations that lead to a panel discussion.

# Title of the original session submission

Data sharing in public health emergencies

# Session description for the original session submission 

Humanity has a long history of sharing, especially in the wake of disasters. Data sharing is a relatively new flavour under this broader theme, but one that has been receiving attention over the last few years, especially in the context of public health emergencies like the Ebola or Zika outbreaks. 

In response, researchers, research institutions, journals, funders and others have taken steps towards increasing the sharing of data around public health emergencies. These measures range from the adoption of open lab notebooks to modifications of policies and funding lines, and they include conversations around infrastructure and cultural change. 

In this session, representatives from various stakeholder groups are invited to contribute their perspectives in a series of lightning talks, highlighting steps that have already been taken as well as challenges still lying ahead.

Together, these talks - and the ensuing discussion - are to span the entire data life cycle of public health emergencies, from preventive measures and routine public health surveillance data to the tracking of pathogens, investigating pathogen transmission and other host-pathogen interactions, as well as diagnostics, vaccination, epidemiological modelling and other related efforts.

This submission addresses all four of the high-level themes of SciDataCon 2018:
- The digital frontiers of global science;
- a global and inclusive data revolution;
- applications, progress and challenges of data intensive research;
- data infrastructure and enabling practices for international and collaborative research.
