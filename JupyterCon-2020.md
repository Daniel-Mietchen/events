# About

This file hosts a submission to [JupyterCon 2020](https://jupytercon.com/). 

# Form fields

The submission form has a number of fields. I will document my responses to the non-personal ones below.

## Title

* Jupyter in the Wikimedia ecosystem

## Audience level

* I chose "Novice" since the options were "Novice/ Intermediate/ Expert"

## Brief summary

*Short paragraph, maximum 400 characters. If your proposal is accepted, this will be in the public program.*

Jupyter interacts in various ways with Wikipedia and its sister sites. It forms the subject of some wiki pages, while Jupyter notebooks serve as references in others, help generate illustrations, assist in wiki editing or serve educational or testing purposes, and a JupyterHub facilitates such activities. This talk will look into how such interactions can be strengthened further to mutual benefit.

## Outline

*This is a self-contained statement that summarizes the objective of the proposal, its outline, central thesis, and key takeaways. After reading the description, the audience should have an idea of the overall presentation and what they will learn. The description should also make clear what background knowledge is expected from the attendees. Include links to relevant source code, articles, videos, or other information that add context to your proposal.*

Objective

* Make Jupyter community more familiar with current and potential usage of Jupyter in Wikimedia contexts
* Make Jupyter resources more findable and accessible by leveraging the reach of Wikimedia projects

Outline

* Usage examples
  * Wiki pages about Jupyter
    * Wikipedia
      * English
        * Project Jupyter
        * Jupyter notebook
        * JupyterHub
      * many other languages
    * Wikimedia Commons
    * Wikidata
      * Wikidata frontends
        - [WikiDP](https://wikidp.org/search?string=Jupyter)
        - [Scholia](https://scholia.toolforge.org/topic/Q70357595)
    * Wikibooks
    * Wikimania
    * etc.
  * Jupyter notebooks as references
  * Jupyter notebooks to generate illustrations
  * Jupyter notebooks for educational purposes
  * Jupyter notebooks for presentional purposes
  * Jupyter notebooks for testing purposes
  * PAWS

Central thesis

* The two communities are mission-aligned and would benefit from closer interaction

Key takeaways

* If you wrote a Jupyter notebook for educational purposes, chances are that it could serve these purposes through Wikimedia projects too.
* If you wrote code that adds functionality to Jupyter notebooks, JupyterHub, Binder or othere parts of the Jupyter ecosystem, chances are that the functionality would be of interest to Jupyter users within the Wikimedia community, or even to users of Wikimedia contents.

Required background knowledge

* Just the basics of Jupyter notebooks

## Affiliation 

*For the purpose of this talk.*

* School of Data Science, University of Virginia, USA

## Past experience and any other information you would like the reviewers to know.

*If you have given a talk or poster before, feel free to include links to slides or videos.*

I briefly hinted at some aspects of the interaction between Wikimedia and Jupyter in my 2017 JupyterCon talk - see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Via7gBrjxHI#t=4m55s .

## Is this your first time presenting at JupyterCon? 

* No.
