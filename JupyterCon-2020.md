# About

This file hosts a proposal to [JupyterCon 2020](https://jupytercon.com/), which I [submitted](https://twitter.com/EvoMRI/status/1285746449846870016) on 21 July 2020. 

# Form fields

The submission form has a number of fields. I will document my responses to the non-personal ones below.

## Title

* Jupyter in the Wikimedia ecosystem

## Audience level

* I chose "Novice" since the options were "Novice/ Intermediate/ Expert"

## Brief summary

*Short paragraph, maximum 400 characters. If your proposal is accepted, this will be in the public program.*

Jupyter interacts in various ways with Wikipedia and its sister sites. It forms the subject of some wiki pages, while Jupyter notebooks serve as references in others, help generate illustrations, assist in wiki editing or serve educational or testing purposes, and a JupyterHub facilitates such activities. This talk will look into how such interactions can be strengthened further to mutual benefit.

## Outline

*This is a self-contained statement that summarizes the objective of the proposal, its outline, central thesis, and key takeaways. After reading the description, the audience should have an idea of the overall presentation and what they will learn. The description should also make clear what background knowledge is expected from the attendees. Include links to relevant source code, articles, videos, or other information that add context to your proposal.*

This presentation is intended to (i) make the Jupyter community more familiar with current and potential usages of Jupyter in Wikimedia contexts, (ii) explore how Jupyter resources can become more findable and accessible by leveraging the reach of Wikimedia projects. It will be given based on https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/blob/master/JupyterCon-2020.md and does not assume any background knowledge other than a basic familiarity with Jupyter.

After a brief introduction to Wikimedia projects - which include Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons and Wikidata and similar collaborative sites - we will explore existing usage examples of Jupyter in Wikimedia contexts. Based on the assumption that the two communities are mission-aligned and would benefit from closer interaction, we will then consider potential usage examples based on overlaps in mission and activity of the Jupyter and Wikimedia communities.

In closing, developers and maintainers of Jupyter-based educational materials or Jupyter-related functionality shall be stimulated to consider whether and how such materials or functionality might fit into the Wikimedia ecosystem, or, conversely, how they can leverage Wikimedia resources for educational and related purposes.

## Is this your first time presenting at JupyterCon? 

* No.

  * Jupyter notebooks for presentional purposes
  * Jupyter notebooks for testing purposes
  * PAWS
* If you wrote a Jupyter notebook for educational purposes, chances are that it could serve these purposes through Wikimedia projects too.
* If you wrote code that adds functionality to Jupyter notebooks, JupyterHub, Binder or othere parts of the Jupyter ecosystem, chances are that the functionality would be of interest to Jupyter users within the Wikimedia community, or even to users of Wikimedia contents.
