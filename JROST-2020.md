# About

This file hosts information related to my participation in the [JROST 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201103004144/https://investinopen.org/community/jrost-2020-conference/) conference taking place online on 14-16 December 2020.

# Call for session proposals

The call is for three types of contributions:
- lightning talks
- breakout sessions
- panel sessions

The relative time afforded to the different session types has already been sketched out in the [preliminary agenda](web.archive.org/web/20201103004337/https://investinopen.org/jrost2020-agenda/). 

In the following, I will provide the key questions from the [submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe7iKPRgNEKGogVd9xdKNL8JzzwkYw6MuENA-rYU8AmrK2mgw/viewform?usp=sf_link), as well as my responses. The form is designed such that it allows a maximum of one per session type.

## Lightning talks

*There will be two sessions of lightning talks (5 minutes each). These talks are great ways to share out your work, problems you’re wrestling with, and other ideas for collaboration.*

### Proposed talk title

*(15 words)*

### What's your talk about?

## “Open in Practice” Breakout Discussions

*Part of JROST is being able to have smaller conversations with your peers to learn with and from one another. We are looking for a few participants to lead smaller breakout discussions (~45 min each), and share tactics and experiences with the group. Key topics to think about include Funding and Sustainability, Technical Development and Interoperability, and Operational Support.*
*(Example: Diversifying your funding streams, building integrations with partners, pivoting your project - and what you’ve learned, choosing an organizational home, etc.)*

### Proposed breakout title 

*(15 words)*

### What would you like to share? 

*(250 words)*


## Panel Discussions

*We would love ideas for diverse panels (2-3 speakers + a moderator) to include in our program on Collaboration in Action (~45 min - 1 hour). Have ideas for panels you’d like to see? Want to lead one yourself? Please let us know.*


### Proposed panel title

*(15 words)*

### What's the panel about?

### Do you want to moderate/lead this panel?

* [ ] Yes (I or someone I identify will lead)

* [ ] Maybe (I could be convinced with the right support)
