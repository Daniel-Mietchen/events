# About

This file hosts information related to my participation in the [JROST 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201103004144/https://investinopen.org/community/jrost-2020-conference/) conference taking place online on 14-16 December 2020.

# Call for session proposals

The call is for three types of contributions:
- lightning talks
- breakout sessions
- panel sessions

The relative time afforded to the different session types has already been sketched out in the [preliminary agenda](web.archive.org/web/20201103004337/https://investinopen.org/jrost2020-agenda/). 

In the following, I will provide the key questions from the [submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe7iKPRgNEKGogVd9xdKNL8JzzwkYw6MuENA-rYU8AmrK2mgw/viewform?usp=sf_link), as well as my responses. The form is designed such that it allows a maximum of one per session type.

## Lightning talks

*There will be two sessions of lightning talks (5 minutes each). These talks are great ways to share out your work, problems you’re wrestling with, and other ideas for collaboration.*

### Proposed talk title

*(15 words)*

### What's your talk about?

*(250 words)*


## “Open in Practice” Breakout Discussions

*Part of JROST is being able to have smaller conversations with your peers to learn with and from one another. We are looking for a few participants to lead smaller breakout discussions (~45 min each), and share tactics and experiences with the group. Key topics to think about include Funding and Sustainability, Technical Development and Interoperability, and Operational Support.*
*(Example: Diversifying your funding streams, building integrations with partners, pivoting your project - and what you’ve learned, choosing an organizational home, etc.)*

### Proposed breakout title 

*(15 words)*

### What would you like to share? 

*(250 words)*


## Panel Discussions

*We would love ideas for diverse panels (2-3 speakers + a moderator) to include in our program on Collaboration in Action (~45 min - 1 hour). Have ideas for panels you’d like to see? Want to lead one yourself? Please let us know.*


### Proposed panel title

*(15 words)*

* ["Open data matters most when the stakes are high"](https://web.archive.org/web/20150906201924/https://medium.com/@WhiteHouse/ten-years-after-katrina-new-orleans-recovery-and-what-data-had-to-do-with-it-3df0bb2467e9)

### What's the panel about?

*(250 words)*

In response to disasters, humanity often responds by sharing more than usual. This sharing takes place in a myriad of ways, some of which have not evolved much in millenia, while others evolve at every occasion or are unique to a particular event. The point of this panel would be to explore mechanisms by which open infrastructures could be leveraged more quickly, more routinely and more comprehensively to reduce disaster risk, to prepare for disasters, to respond to disasters and to share lessons learned from them. The main motivation behind that is that some of the key features of open research &mdash; e.g. speed, verifiability and scalability &mdash; are especially important in disaster contexts, yet the overlap between the open research and the disaster mitigation communities is currently rather limited, so that potential often cannot be fully leveraged.


### Panelist suggestions--please list

*(50 words)*

I don't have this fully worked out but think that combining some people from the JROST community with representatives from organizations like the following would be a promising recipe:

- [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://humdata.org/)
- [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap](https://www.hotosm.org/)
- [Global Indigenous Data Alliance](https://www.gida-global.org/)
- [PreventionWeb](https://www.preventionweb.net)

### Do you want to moderate/lead this panel?

* [ ] Yes (I or someone I identify will lead)
* [ ] No (I'm hoping someone else might run with this!)
* [X] Maybe (I could be convinced with the right support)
