## Title 

Integrating archival workflows with Wikidata

## Abstract

Over the past several years, interest in leveraging [Wikidata](https://wikidata.org/) as an open knowledge base has been growing in areas ranging from cultural heritage institutions to research and technology organizations. With its inherent multilinguality, human-editable interface, community-driven approach to data modeling and curation, systemic connection to Wikipedia and sister projects and alignment with the FAIR Principles for sharing data, there is an emerging consensus that Wikidata represents a significant step for turning Linked Open Data into a practical and useful technology. It provides a bridge between the many siloed knowledge bases that have emerged since Tim Berners-Lee first proposed the notion of the semantic web. Despite this growing interest, there is still a fundamental lack of understanding of what Wikidata's strengths and weaknesses are, or those of Wikibaseâ€”the engine behind Wikidata. While experiments have been proliferating with the use of Wikibase, it is still very much an open question how to create a sustainable, federated ecosystem of knowledge bases to support open research, and what the social, technical, institutional barriers are towards this vision. 

We would like to use this session as an opportunity to identify and discuss user stories from researchers and practitioners working on open research infrastructure and understand what a model could be to get more groups onboard to design a possible path towards this vision. 

This presentation will be given on the basis of https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/blob/master/ArchivesSpace-Online-Forum-2019-wikis.md and focus on how archival workflows can be integrated with Wikidata or Wikibase, particularly to foster broad accessibility to humans and machines, including for collaborative curation.

## Title 

An archival perspective on public health emergencies

## Abstract

Public health emergencies require profound and swift action at scale with limited resources, often on the basis of incomplete information and frequently under rapidly evolving circumstances. While emergency-triggered sharing goes back millennia, the sharing of data and associated metadata is a relatively new flavour under this broader theme, but one that has been receiving steadily growing attention over the last few years, especially in the context of the Ebola or Zika outbreaks. By now, we have reached a point where data sharing must be considered a key component of addressing present, future and even past public health emergencies.

In response, researchers, research institutions, journals, funders and others have taken steps towards increasing the sharing of data around ongoing public health emergencies and in preparation for future ones. These measures range from the adoption of open lab notebooks to modifications of policies and funding lines, and they include conversations around infrastructure and cultural change as well as around the provenance and persistence of emergency-related resources.

This presentation will be given on the basis of https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/blob/master/ArchivesSpace-Online-Forum-2019-emergencies.md and provide an overview of different ways in which the sharing of data has played a role in public health emergencies, highlighting steps that have already been taken over the last decade as well as challenges still lying ahead and concluding with considerations around the potential impact of preserving and sharing data or associated metadata, or failing at that.
