# Poster title

Bridging Science, Art, and Community in the New Arctic through Wikimedia projects

# Poster abstract

Wikipedia and its sister Wikimedia projects like Wikidata, Wikisource and Wikimedia Commons form a popular and multilingual ecosystem of websites and communities dedicated to sharing the worldâ€™s knowledge, including about science, art, the New Arctic and its communities. This poster will highlight some Wikimedia content and initiatives relevant to the New Arctic that span across the natural and social sciences, humanities and arts. The poster will be accompanied by a demo that illustrates how conference participants and their activities could leverage these resources or contribute to enriching them.
