# About

## Title

WikiCite as a hub for collaborative curation of bibliographic and citation metadata

## Abstract

The Wikimedia community has always appreciated the value of reliable sources and built lots of workflows and tools around that. The WikiCite community helps in bringing these initiatives closer together across wikis, languages and disciplines. Right from its start, it has also welcomed participation from others interested in bibliographic and citation information, and built workflows that allow to curate such information collaboratively at Wikimedia scale. 

This contribution will be given on the basis of https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/blob/master/WikiCite-Cologne-2020.md and zoom in on implications that this role as a hub for collaborative curation might have for WikiCite, the Wikimedia community and others engaged in curating bibliographic and citation information.

# Workshops

I have proposed the following two workshops:

- [Scholia workshop](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiCite_Satellite_Cologne_2020/Submission/Scholia_workshop)
- [Planning remote-first WikiCite events](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiCite_Satellite_Cologne_2020/Submission/Planning_remote-first_WikiCite_events)

# Editathon

As a satellite to the official event, I have proposed an [editathon](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lokal_K/WikiCite_2020) in the local Wikimedia premises, focused on WikiCite activities with some connection to Cologne.
