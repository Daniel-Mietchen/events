[International Data Week 2018](http://internationaldataweek.org/programme-overview) combined a number of events around data, particularly research data.

I was mainly involved in three of them
- [SciDataCon 2018](https://www.scidatacon.org/IDW2018/programme/) &mdash; see the SciDataCon sessions in the schedule below
  - see my notes specifically on this at [SciDataCon-2018.md](SciDataCon-2018.md)
- [12th Plenary of the Research Data Alliance](http://www.internationaldataweek.org/rda-12th-plenary) &mdash; see the RDA sessions in the schedule below
- [World Data Science Data Repositories Day 2018](https://www.icsu-wds.org/events/wds-events/data-repositories-day-2018) &mdash; see the WDS session in the schedule below

but also attended parts of [UVA/DSI Data Palooza 2018](https://dsi.virginia.edu/datapalooza2018) remotely.

See [here](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/issues/211) for my notes taken throughout the week.
