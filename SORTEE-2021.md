# About

This file hosts materials related to my potential participation in the [Society for Open Reliable Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary biology (SORTEE) 2021](http://web.archive.org/web/20210601224641/https://www.sortee.org/events/) online conference on 12-14 July 2021.

# Call for proposals

The call for proposals lists four potential submission types, all of which are potential fits for me, so I am jotting down some notes on them here to explore whether to submit something, and what.

## Unconferences

- Valid reasons not to share data

## Hackathons

- Teaching machines to search for evidence for or against a given hypothesis

## Workshops

- Building open scholarly profiles via Scholia

## Short Presentations

Lessons learned from publishing all around the research cycle
