# About

This file hosts materials related to my potential participation in the [Society for Open Reliable Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary biology (SORTEE) 2021](http://web.archive.org/web/20210601224641/https://www.sortee.org/events/) online conference on 12-14 July 2021. My session proposal "Why SORTEE session proposals should default to being open upon submission" was approved on July 1 as Unconference session 11, to take place on 13th July 2021, 16:00-17:00 UTC.

* Topic: The closed nature of submissions to events organized under an open flag
* Abstract: The discussion should sharpen the participants' thoughts on the relative merits of conference submission processes defaulting to open or closed. To this end, I will briefly introduce some open examples and then stimulate discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of such open approaches, particularly in the context of SORTEE.

## Call for proposals

The call for proposals lists four potential submission types, all of which are potential fits for me, so I am jotting down some notes on them here to explore whether to submit something, and what.

## Unconferences

- Valid reasons not to share data
  - Variants:
    - What are typical arguments for not being open, and how to respond to them?
    - Arguments against open science, and how to respond to them
- When was research that was published last week actually performed?
- Why SORTEE session proposals should default to being open upon submission
  - submitted

## Hackathons

- Teaching machines to search for evidence for or against a given hypothesis
- The ecological footprint of computational replication attempts

## Workshops

- Visualizing the research ecosystem of ecosystem research via Wikidata
  - variants:
    - Building open scholarly profiles via Scholia
    - Scholia: Building scholarly profiles via open-source visualizations of open data

## Short Presentations

- Insights from publishing all along the research cycle
- Ask Open Science: an open Q & A site for questions all around open science
