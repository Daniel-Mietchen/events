# About

This file hosts materials related to my planned participation in a [Climate Reality Global Training](https://climaterealityproject.org/apply/globaltraining), for whicch there was an application process. 

Apart from lots of personal information, their form also asked "What do you hope to get out of the Climate Reality Leadership Corps training?", for which a field with a maximum of 1000 characters was allocated but the form would not let me submit it if I had any text in that field. So here is what I wanted to put in there (slightly reformatted):

1. Further systematic progress with my first [New Year Resolution for 2020](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/blob/master/new-year-resolutions/2020.md), which is to "review all of my major professional, volunteer and family activities from the perspective of their sustainability"
1. Increasing my climate-related contact network within and beyond the circles through which I usually engage in climate matters, i.e.  open science, open data, open knowledge and open collaboration, including via Wikipedia and its sister projects
1. Getting new inspiration for what I can do in my volunteer, professional and personal realms to address climate change and related issues
1. Getting a better idea of what to do myself versus where to build on what others are doing
1. Finding new collaborators, learning about what they do and how they go about finding and enriching their niche in terms of addressing climate change
1. Something to inspire my social circles, especially my children and students
1. Applying my skills in a broader context than usual

# History

I initially applied to join the training on July 18-26, 2020, but on July 7, I was notified that my slot would rather be in the follow-up training on August 28-September 3, 2020. On July 30, I received an RSVP request for the latter event, to which I responsed affirmatively on August 1. While this file was originally created as July-2020-Climate-Reality-Leadership-Corps-Global-Training.md, I then changed it to Summer-2020-Climate-Reality-Leadership-Corps-Global-Training.md.
