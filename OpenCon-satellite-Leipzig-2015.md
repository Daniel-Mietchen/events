# Introduction
## What is Open research?
* [Video introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwW1-X3glak)
	 * *scientists __sharing__ their __research__ with the world as soon as they __record__ it for themselves*

## What means open in this context?
* [Open Definition](http://opendefinition.org/)
* no limits to the kind of contexts (e.g. academic, non-commercial) in which the shared research can be reused and adapted

## What means research?
* systematic inquiry in the pursuit of knowledge (for the benefit of humanity)

## What means recording in this context?
* the collection of information about a particular piece of research that is sufficiently detailed that people (and increasingly machines) trained in this domain of knowledge can interpret and __assess__ this research in light of existing knowledge and past, ongoing or future research

## What means sharing (with the world) in this context?
* providing access to the recorded research by means available to the widest possible audience 
* with reuse rights as per the Open Definition

## What means assessment in this context?
* evaluating whether 
	 * the planning, execution and recording of a particular body of research is appropriate to the research subject
	 * any conclusions drawn from the research are appropriate based on the available records
	 * the research is novel/ exciting/ buzzword-compliant (often)
	 * the research addresses problems relevant outside academia (rarely)

#Peer review
* exists for both proposed research (e.g. research grants, or applications for measurement time at research facilities) and performed research (e.g. classical publications, database entries, project reports)
* traditionally non-public, but with a good deal of experimentation lately, especially in the context of scholarly publications
	 * point in time: 
		 * before drafting
		 * during drafting
		 * before submission (to journals, funders, preprint servers, databases, code repositories etc.)
		 * after submission
		 * after publication
	 * mode: 
		 * submissions
		 	* known to reviewers
		 	* known or not to public
		 * authors
		 	* known or not to reviewers
		 	* known to public after publication
		 * reviewers
		 	* known or not to authors
		 	* known or not to public after publication
		 * reviews
		 	* known or not to authors
		 	* known or not to public after publication

# What is NIH?
* [National Institutes of Health](http://nih.gov) in Bethesda, Maryland, USA
* a Federal Agency within the [Department of Health and Human Services](http://www.hhs.gov/) (HHS)
* the world's largest biomedical research agency
* [NIH Mission](http://www.nih.gov/about/mission.htm)

## Data science at NIH
* [Associate Director for Data Science (ADDS)](https://datascience.nih.gov/adds)
  * to "provide input to the overall NIH vision and actions undertaken by each of the 27 Institutes and Centers in support of biomedical research as a digital enterprise"
* [ADDS website](http://datascience.nih.gov/)

# Sharing policies relevant to NIH

## At the international level

  * [Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing](http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/bethesda.htm)
* field-specific, e.g. 
  * [Bermuda principles](http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/About-us/Policy/Policy-and-position-statements/WTD002751.htm) for human genome sequencing

## At the U.S. Federal level

## At the HHS level
* [Public Access](http://www.hhs.gov/open/publicaccess/index.html)
   * ["By ensuring that all publicly released research data is provided in open, machine-readable formats that can easily be accessed for computational analysis and machine-learning, it is our hope that we can help realize the promise of ‘big data’ in medicine and healthcare."](http://www.hhs.gov/idealab/2015/02/27/hhs-expands-approach-making-research-results-freely-available-public/)

* The [report on the strategic vision for the National Library of Medicine](http://acd.od.nih.gov/reports/Report-NLM-06112015-ACD.pdf) recommends that NLM should
   * "be a leader and innovator in open science efforts worldwide"
   * "lead efforts to support and catalyze open science, data sharing, and research reproducibility, striving to promote the concept that biomedical information and its transparent analysis are public"
   * and, in particular, "lead efforts to promulgate and implement best practices in open source, open science, standards, and data harmonization, forming partnerships across communities, stakeholder organizations, agencies, and countries" as well as "be an active participant in the design and oversight of programs that incentivize and celebrate the open sharing of data and resources."

# Data management plans
* Anyone here ever booked an organized travel? What did you travel agency provide you with?
* Now imagine it's not people that travel, but data.
* [Data management plans at NIH](http://libguides.northwestern.edu/c.php?g=217095&p=1433951#s-lg-box-wrapper-5412965)

* [OA Compliance Checking for Wellcome Trust](https://github.com/CottageLabs/oacwellcome)
* my notes on [data management plans](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/datascience/blob/master/data-management-plans.md)
* What about funders leading the research community by example in terms of being more open in the way they work?
	 * Open data from funders might help research *about* research funding.
