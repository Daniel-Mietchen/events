# About

This file hosts a submission to [WeMissiPRES](https://www.dpconline.org/events/wemissipres), the virtual iPRES conference on 22-24 September 2020 that replaces the canceled in-person one. I submitted it shortly before the deadline on 19 August 2020, and the content I entered in their form is also available below. On August 26, I was informed of the acceptance of the submission, and we were requested to confirm our intention to present, which we did.

For the presentation itself, I ended up not being connected, so Mark Graham [presented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2p0OTE5ZHM#t=2h28m).

## Please submit a 100 word description of your presentation, thinking about the theme which best fits your proposal and how you would like to present it. *

In catastrophic events, be they natural or human-triggered, circumstances can change profoundly, quickly and with long-lasting effects on potentially broad swaths of the affected populations as well as their surroundings, including physical and digital infrastructure. In such situations, efficient communication is key but may have to be improvised or adapted to the situation at hand. This often means that the channels used for that tend to be ephemeral, so their digital preservation provides additional challenges. In this talk, we will discuss examples of disaster communication, highlight opportunities for the future and outline how the digital preservation community can get involved.

## Please describe the intended format for your presentation e.g. slides with voice over, lecture with camera on, demo, multiple presenters, live survey etc (50 words max) *

Slides and demo with voiceover, by both presenters and with a live survey
